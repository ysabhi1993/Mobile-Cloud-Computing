# Mobile-Cloud-Computing
- A project which implements Android application on cloud to run analytics on user information to decide the success or failure  of a conference.

- The frontend was coded in Android and Java.

- The Backend used a Virtual Machine on Google Compute Engine, Google Storage to store a report after running the analytics and MySQL DB to store the user information. 

- We also used Firebase authentication to log user information into our system.

- The Analytics are run based on the location of the user who registers and attends a conference. We track the location of the user every 10min and use that information to decide for how long the user was in the conference.

- There will be a lot of user information logged in. Those details can be used to decide on what subjects the conferences should be held and also in which locations they should be held.
